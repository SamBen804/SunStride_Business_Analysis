    "#### Notes on ALL Columns:\n",
    "- Camper ID: Unique student identifier (eliminates the names of all students)\n",
    "- Age: student age for the year at camp being analyzed.\n",
    "- Current grade: student's grade the year being analyzed\n",
    "- Gender: binary column with values that actually represent the student's sex\n",
    "- School: this column contains the name of the student's school, this information is relatively granular and may not be very impactful as a feature.\n",
    "- Years at camp: if the value is 1, then this is the student's first year traveling with Moondance, and so on up to 6 meaning this is the student's 6th summer!\n",
    "- Sibling count: [DROP] This count does not represent the same information as the '2021 > Enrolled sibling count' and it is likely going to be dropped. \n",
    "- Lead source:[IMPUTE] Contains information about how a student was introduced to Moondance with various options such as 'Friend' or 'Website'. Impute the 3 nulls to be 'No Source'.\n",
    "- Primary family address 1: [DROP] Details the students street address. Drop this column - too granular and too personal. **Maybe drop this when dropping the student first and last name**\n",
    "- Primary family city: Details the city where the student/family lives. MAY be able to use this later for project goal #3\n",
    "- Primary family country: [IMPUTE] Details the student's country where they currently reside. Impute all the nulls to be 'United States'\n",
    "- Primary family state: [MANUAL CLEAN] Details the students home state. One of the students is from Atlanta, meaning they are likely from Georgia, the other is an international student who doesn't have a state. Maybe make an \"INTL\" state option\n",
    "- Primary family zip: To be used for project goal #3\n",
    "- Do you have a copy of this year’s catalog?: [DROP] Initally suspected this column would show how well distributed the marketing materials (specifically the catalog) are spread/whether or not there appears to be a correlation between enrollment and catalog possession. There are too many null values for this to be a useful feature.\n",
    "- trip code & - trip + section name (all): [DROP - 'test' student, as null] Details the trip code and section the student was assigned/attened. There appears to be a 'test' student included in the data\n",
    "- Enrolled sibling count [IMPUTE nulls to be zeros, OneHotEncode values (0, 1, 2)]: Details if a student has a family member also traveling with Moondance this summer. \n",
    "- 2021 > Status: [DROP] ALL should be 'Enrolled'\n",
    "- Unenrollment date: [CLEAN] If the student changed trips there will be a value in this column. Can be mapped to be a boolean value rather than the date.\n",
    "- 2021 > First enrollment request date: contains the first date the student attempted to enroll. This does not indicate whther or not the student was actually placed on a trip this day. IT MAY BE INTERESTING to engineer a feature that measures the number of days between first enrollment request/attempt and actual enrollment day to see if there's a correlation between the length of time it took for the child to get on a trip and their likelihood to try and come back                                 \n",
    "- 2021 > Is your child attending with a friend?: [CLEAN] A Yes/No question that details whether or not a child will be travelling with a peer. To be cast as boolean values!                   \n",
    "- ^Student Eval: [CLEAN - the \"Off the Charts\" distinction should be a '6' ENCODE the values are ordinal] This column details the rating the students gave their trip 1 - 6 (\"Off the Charts\"). 110 values appear to be missing. May need to impute these by filling in the average OR 'Missing Info'.\n",
    "- ^Expectations: This feature contains values such as 'Met expectations', 'Exceeded expectations' and 'Did not meet expectations'. May be treated as an ordinal value to be encoded? Could cast these values as numbers also, for ease of working (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "- ^Trip Length: Similar to the '^Expectations' feature, this column contains values 'Too Short', 'Just Right', 'Too Long'. May be treated as an ordinal value to be encoded? Could cast these values as numbers also, for ease of working (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "- ^^Interested in Another Trip?: Options = 'Yes', 'Not Sure', 'No'\n",
    "- ^^^Future Trip? Details the trip options that the student may be interested in for future summers!\n",
    "- ^^^^Leader Rating of Student: Details the score the leader team provided regarding the student's behavior on the trip/their overall ability to meet trip expectations.\n",
    "- 2022 > Status: This column is the 'target' as it details whether or not a student enrolled the following summer, which would indicate a positive (1) or negative (0) result.\n",
    "- 2022 > trip code: This column details the actual trip the student enrolled in for the following season. Could be an interesting exploration to see if they ACTUALLY went on one of the trips that they listed that they may be interested in attending. Is a stretch, but could be used later in goals #2 or #3, so it will remain in the dataset even if it is initally dropped for goal #1."
